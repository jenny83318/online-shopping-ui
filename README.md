# JOLUI

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Demo link

This website on Render's free plan shuts down after 15 minutes of inactivity, so the first visit after that takes a few minutes to restart.
